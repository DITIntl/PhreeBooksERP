PhreeBooks Release 5
=========================

UPDATE 2017-06-04 - PhreeSoft has changed its position on the PhreeBooks project. We will no longer support any PhreeBoks versions prior to Release 5. Release 4 is under development by team member Rene and the release date is unknown. PhreeSoft will soon release it's GPL version of Bizuno and PhreeBooks 5.0 will be the officially supported stand alone version of Bizuno with a PhreeBooks portal. A free upgrade script will be available to upgrade your database from PhreeBooks R3.7 to PhreeBooks 5.0. Note that this involves a small bit of code to operate in a stand-alone capacity but primarily relies on the GPL Bizuno library, also hosted on GitHub. Most of the extensions that existed in the PhreeBooks R3.7 release will still be available but for a nominal cost. This is necessary to help cover some of the hard costs running this project, like hosting, ssl certificates, code signing certificates, etc.

UPDATE 2017-04-14 - EFFECTIVE 2017-05-01 PHREESOFT WILL NO LONGER SUPPORT THE PHREEBOOKS PROJECT. PHREESOFT WILL BE RELEASING AN OPEN SOURCE VERSION OF BIZUNO IN THE COMING MONTHS AS A SCALED DOWN VERSION OF THE CURRENTLY HOSTED APPLICATION WITH EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. SEE HTTP://WWW.PHREESOFT.COM FOR MORE DETAILS.

PHREEBOOKS R4.0 IS IN DEVELOPMENT HOSTED HERE AND THE PROJECT LEAD/PRINCIPLE DEVELOPER WILL FALL TO RENE. ALL PHREEBOOKS ACTIVITY HOSTED AT THE PHREESOFT.COM WEBSITE WILL BE DISCONTINUED. STATUS, BUGS AND OTHER PHREEBOOKS QUERIES WILL BE HANDLED IN THIS REPOSITORY.

PhreeBooks accounting was developed as an open source ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) web-based application written for the small business community. The goal is to provide a multi-language web-based end-to-end enterprise management tool. Written in the widely availalbe PHP scripting language with the robust MYSQL database engine.
