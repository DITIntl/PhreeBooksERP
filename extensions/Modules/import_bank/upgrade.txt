If modified. Copy the import_bank.xml to a save location. (modules/import_bank/file/import_bank)
the new xml file has one addition.
    <Field>
      <Name>iban_to</Name>
      <TagName>iban Tegenrekening</TagName>
      <Type>varchar(255)</Type>
      <Description>the iban account number to which the money was transferd</Description>
      <Properties>default NULL</Properties>
      <CanImport>1</CanImport>
      <Required>0</Required>
    </Field>


It is best to add this to your old xml file.
if you want to use the new iban field change the TagName by the column name of the iban column ( found in your document you want to import)

Till now it was only posible to have one bank_account field per contact. 
Now you can have a multiple of both iban and bank_account fields. 
all you have to do is to create the extra fields in (module administration >contact module> custom fields.) 
all that is required is that part of the field name can be identified as 'bank_account' or 'iban'
so you could create a field 'bank_account_1' and 'iban_1'.

Note: If a iban is supplied and there are iban fields present in the contacts table. 
then a search will be done on the iban field and not the bank account number.
